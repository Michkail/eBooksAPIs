The test consists in creating a Web API Project for a JobBoard website. Similar to indeed.com, companies will be able to create and publish new job offers that people will then be able to see.
```

##  Client will be able to communicate with our Web API from 2 URL Endpoints:
```
1.  api/slurp/ - accepts GET and POST methods,
    allowing to create new instances and retrieve a list with all the available job offer instances.

2   api/slurp/<int:pk>/ - accepts GET, PUT and
    DELETE, allowing a user to retrieve, update or delete an object instance.
```
